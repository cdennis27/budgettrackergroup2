# Budget tracker for budget control! 

## Description

Simple code for a Budget tracker using interactive API's based on guidelines described on Challenge 7 Team Project of University of Toronto Bootcamp.

Used BNP Currency Exchange API, AdviceSlip API to give you the best "Tip of the Day" and DayJS to update date and time in the application.

Utized a Foundation CSS framework to optimze time during application styling.

Stored on client-side storage budget information for quick re-load and updates, with easy to use remove buttons, if anything added in error or to be discarded by the user.

## Future Improvements

Plans to insert ChartJS API to provide budget information in a graphic user interface for better user experience.

Addition of more currencies to our Currency Exchange tool.
